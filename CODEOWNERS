# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in

# @global-owner1 and @global-owner2 will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.

# Define overrides for specific project resources in this section.
# These overrides will only request PR from the people and resources as defined.
# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies JS files, only @js-owner and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.
